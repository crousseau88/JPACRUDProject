# JPA C.R.U.D PROJECT




## Description 
This project is a dynamic web app that allows a user to search through an inventory database of sneakers to see what is in stock. The user can search by the sneakers style code, or by the shoes ID in the database which they can find by clicking a view inventory button. Once they complete a search by style a list of shoes in that style are displayed or if a search by ID is completed the shoe related to that ID will be displayed. Once the shoes are displayed the user has the option to update or delete that shoe from the inventory database.

## Lessons Learned 
This project helped me understand how to build mySQL/SQL databases and how to build a dynamic web app using that database so that a user can perform CRUD operations via the app. I further honed my skills on building and utilizing JSP's and have a better understanding of how they work in conjunction with the controllers to access and manipulate data within the table. I wanted to create something that made inventory tracking simple and straight forward for the user as I have used excel sheets in the past to do so and it is far more tedious that way. This web app made searching, updating, adding, and removing inventory far easier than inputting into an excel sheet.
